## Description

Team Profile Generator is a command-line application that dynamically generates a static "team profile" page, ``team.html``, from a user's input using the Inquirer package. The page resizes itself dynamically as the screen size changes.

## Walkthrough

Here is a link to a [walkthrough video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-JnNamKpLE&ab_channel=RanGamboa) to show the application functionality.

## Installation

This project uses node and npm. Install them if you do not have them on your local machine. 

## Usage

Use ``node .\index.js`` to launch this application. It will take you through a series of inputs to build a simple and straightforward ``team.html`` file for your dev team.

## Contribution

Thanks!

## Testing

Of the 17 total tests run via Jest, 6 unfortunately failed as evidenced in the walkthrough video. I was unable to find the cause of the failures; they were similar failures for ``Engineer.js``, ``Intern.js`` and ``Manager.js``. The code looked error-free so I suspect I have omitted a crucial part of the syntax for the tests to pass.
